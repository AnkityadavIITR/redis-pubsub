# Scalable Group Messaging System with Redis Pub/Sub

## Components of the System

### Express/Fastify Server

Your backend server (Express or Fastify) will handle incoming HTTP requests from clients and manage the WebSocket connections for real-time communication.

### WebSocket Communication

Use WebSocket to establish a bidirectional communication channel between the server and clients. This is essential for real-time updates.

### Redis Pub/Sub

Redis will be used for its Pub/Sub capabilities. In this architecture, Redis acts as a message broker. The server will publish messages to specific channels, and connected clients subscribe to these channels to receive updates.

## Workflow

### User Connection

When a user connects to the server (via WebSocket), assign a unique identifier to the user and establish a WebSocket connection.

### Group Creation and Subscription

When a user wants to create or join a group, the server subscribes the user's WebSocket connection to a Redis channel associated with that group. For example, if the group has an ID of "group123," the server subscribes the user to the Redis channel "group123."

### Message Broadcasting

When a user sends a message to a group, the server publishes the message to the corresponding Redis channel. All users subscribed to that channel will receive the message in real-time.

```javascript
// Publishing a message to a Redis channel
redisPublisher.publish('group123', JSON.stringify({ sender: 'user1', message: 'Hello, everyone!' }));
